# Effective Notetaking

## 1. Introduction

Knowing what to expect is a vital factor in getting the most from both books and lecturers.

Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being smart.

You need to understand:

- Why it works
- How it works
- When it works
- When it doesn't
- How to use it effectively

You also need to understand your own learning style, to help you assess whether a particular strategy is right for *you*.

The effective and long-term use of any memory strategy requires 2 things:

- that you understand why and how and when the strategy works, and
- that you practice the strategy enough to achieve mastery

The distinction between note-taking and active reading is somewhat arbitrary. Reading actively often involves taking notes; taking notes often requires you to read. One such strategy involves activating prior knowledge in preparation for reading about/taking notes about a subject. This is called priming, and it really does help, especially when the subject matter is difficult or unfamiliar.

> The questions on that page are very sharp.

# 2. Making note-taking an effective strategy

Sometimes note-taking helps you remember information, and sometimes it doesn't.

Note-taking != Note-making

We take notes from books and lectures (much more difficult), we make notes as preparation for an essay or presentation or exam, to clarify our thoughts.

The act of note-taking is about how to encode information in your brain, not necessarily remembering. For that, it is important to:

- Paraphrase
- Organize
- Make sense of the information

Unless used as a stepping stone *verbatim notes* are quite useless.

Several factors for effective note-taking:

- density
- style
- organization
- skill

In the case of lectures, information should be presented more slowly.

Personality matters, but effective methods are effective regardless of the person.

However, one factor that should be paramount to the discussion is your limits in terms of working memory capacity.

## The Importance of Working Memory Capacity

WMC correlates highly with fluid intelligence (fluid intelligence refers to general reasoning and problem-solving abilities, while crystallized intelligence refers to cognitive functions associated with knowledge).

In fact, a study found that a sutendt's ability to take good notes and benefit from them is better predicted by his working memory than by his grade point average.

Part of it is making inferences, which requires holding connections in our WM.

Indications are that students with a low working memory capacity use less effective strategies when reading because such strategies are less demanding.

## What Working Memory Is

**To put information into our long-term memory store, we must encode it**, which means, for the most part, we must actively process it, work on it. This we term being "in working memory". Essentially, being in working memory is a way of saying information is currently being worked on.

Similarly, when we retrieve information &mdash; get it out of the memory store / "remember" it &mdash; the information again passes through this state of consciousness, this working memory.

Our long-term memory store is incredibly large, but the amount we can process at any one time is very small.

## Working memory capacity and the magic number seven

Current research is actually converging at 4+-1 and not 7+-2 as it used to be believed. And only one item of them can be in your full focus at any one time. But it also seems likely you can also hold another 3 or so items in a state of readiness, ready to jump into working memory.

That said, 1 through 7 could either be individual chunks or a single abstraction chunk.

What may be more important is how long it takes you to say the words &mdash; information is usually held in working memory in the form of an acoustic, sound-based, code. It appears that you can only hold in WM what you can say in 1.5-2 seconds. Slow speakers are therefore penalized. This also explains why we tend to talk very fast when we have a lot of information we want to disgorge.

## There's more than one working memory

Domain-specific WM are still debated, however there is reasonable consensus that verbal and visuospatial information have different stores. This is important because it means you can increase the amount of information you're currently holding by using both systems. But the most important part of working memory, it now appears, is the executive control &mdash; your ability to control attention; your ability to concentrate and not be distracted by competing demands.

## Working memory is about attention

We tend to focus on the more deliberate concentration ability when we think of attention, but these two aspects of attention are both important, and indeed, it may be that the ability to ignore irrelevant information is the more important. In fact, it may be that WM capacity is *only* critical when there's inference.

Emotions can be highly distracting.

Most importantly and least obviously, conflicting, inconsistent, or merely different, information is a source of interference. For example, holding your goal in mind, is a possible source of interference.

Think of information gathering as rolling a snowball. As long as the information all sticks together in a coherent, consistent, meaningful ball, you're fine.

The cognitive load is the extent to which the material makes demands on working memory. There are 2 parts to it:

- intrinsic (how dificult the material is)
- Extrinsic (how it's presented)

Research suggests that the format of the material is only important when the intrinsic load is high.

# Selection Strategies

> Anything that helps you select the most important information is good.

Distinguishing the important from the unimportant information is arguably the most critical skill in successful studying. Unfortunately, no one has yet come up with an effective way of teaching this skill.

(...) You do, however, need a certain degree of background knowledge. This is why most students take lots of notes when they are new to the subject and become more selective with time. It's also why it helps to read relevant material before a lecture.

There are a number of strategies which may be considered selection strategies:

- highlighting
- headings
- summaries

## Highlighting Important Information

Highlighting also depends on the person doing the highlighting having the same goals as you.

Highlighting important terms is better than nothing, but quite excessive anyway. More colors might help in creating a layered database, but it might also overload your brain anyway.

Dense material, which end up requiring too much highlighting should actually be accompanied by a notebook.

> The text on Benjamin Franklin is actually quite interesting. Franklin was a dubious man.

It's hard to know what's important when you don't know what you're supposed to be interested in. A specific purpose &mdash; a goal &mdash; makes it much easier.

Highlighting causes you to direct more attention to the selected words. Such words are more likely to be recalled. However, there are a number of provisos:

- If the material is familiar to you, it won't be affected by the highlighting.
- If the text is brief, particular details won't be helped by highlighting.
- Highlighting should be simple, using different methods doesn't necessarily improve the result but might actually harm it.

In other words, you should only highlight details you don't already know, and only when the text is long enough to benefit from it.

**Highlighting acts to direct attention. It doesn't improve recall as such, what it does is improve recall of those parts highlighted &mdash; at the expense of the rest of the text. It is therefore vital that the right information be highlighted.**

### What Should Be Highlightet?

Selection can be a problem when the teacher or writer is doing the highlighting, because the details that should be selected will be different depending on the goals of the reader and their familiarity with the material.

> If almost all the material is highlighted, what's actually being highlighted is the text that's not highlighted.

- Restrict highlighting to at most 10% of the text &mdash; one line in 10
- Select those details that you want to remember, and *don't think you will*.
- In information-dense text, or where the text is difficult, use highlighting only as an adjunct to other strategies.
- Highlighting is also likely to be ineffective when you are working under severe time constraints.

The main value of highlighting (as a strategy) appears to lie in its encouragement to spend more time with the material. It also helps in aiding concentration.

## Headings highlight structure

Placing summarized headings on a complex text might help you get a better top-bottom view of its contents.

The presence of headings has been found to produce better summaries, better outlines, and better memory for the main points of a text.

> Headings are organizational signals. Other organizational signals are overviews and topical summaries.

Headings usually help readers remember *more topics, but less about each topic*.

A comparison of the effects of an overview, a topical summary, and headings, found no difference in the amount of information remembered without specific prompts (free recall).

However, signalizng doesn't always help your ability to recall information. It seems it actually also isn't very helpful when it comes to recognition (which is the type of memory you may be relying on in multi-choice tests).

## How do headings help memory?

**How easily you remember details you've read in a text depends heavily on the degree to which the details have been integrated with the rest of the material.** In expository texts, the connection between items is usually less predictable.

The difficulty you experience in remembering a text is directly a consequence of the extent to which the information flows in a "logical" order. (That's probably why large stories, like the Odyssey, could still be repeated by so many people trhoughout all Greece.)

You can counteract the failure of many texts to provide headings, or to provide effective headings, by using a topic structure strategy. Organizational signals like headings appear to help recall by encouraging you to choose the more effective topic structure strategy. They do this by emphasizing the transitions between topics, and by articulating the topics, that is, summing them up in a pithy phrase.

## Learning to use the topic structure strategy

Different types of text structure:

1. Description: extension or clarification of main ideas through explanations, examples, or information about attributes. *in particular, for instance, for example, is defined*
1. Collections: a list of facts or elements. *in addition to, and, and, a number of, many, one, two, three*
1. Classification: where items are grouped in classes. *belongs to, types, classes, categories, group*
1. Sequence: a connecting series of events or steps, possibly causally related. *first, second... finally, therefore, consequently, the next, if... then, leads, to, causes, because*
1. Comparison: where two or more things are compared or contrasted. *likewise, similarly, same, in comparison*
1. Problem: discussion of a problem and its solution, or a question and its answer. (Comparison: *likewise, similarly, same, in comparison*, Contrast: *in contrast, but, on the other hand, on the contrary, different*)

The text structure:

- cues you to what is important
- helps you ask the right questions
- tells you how the ideas in the text are related
- provides a structure for your notes
- cues you to the best format for your notes.

> The consolidation text on page ~42-45 is quite nice when it comes to understanding better how memories move around the brain.

### A further effect of signals

Remembering is not only about putting information in; it's also about getting it out again. Signals also are potentially helpful in recalling.

When there are no signals, recall tends to be strongly affected by standard memory factors such as:

- serial position
- familiarity
- elaboration

In other words, if you don’t use the text structure to encode and recall the information, you’re most likely to preferentially remember the information that you already knew, information that appeared at the start or end of the text, and information that was discussed a lot.

Characteristics of a skilled reader

Skilled readers demonstrate their sensitivity to topic structure in
several ways:

- they read topic-introducing sentences more slowly
- they read topic sentences that are difficult to relate to the topic more slowly1
- they recall more superordinate items than subordinate (e.g., categories rather than category members).

> Headings != Topics. Headings talk about the text itself, while topics might be definitions, classifications, etc.

### Readiness to think

The pleasure you take in engaging your mind

It's assumed that this occurs because students who readily engage in effortful processing are more inclined to use the structure strategy when confronted with a text without signals.

It has also been suggested that headings only help when students already have a high knowledge of the subject discussed in the text. This is consistent with the theory that headings work by activating prior knowledge.

Headings may, however, have other benefits for students with little prior knowledge &mdash; in helping them organize the information contained in the text, and in helping them search for specific items

When are headings most useful?

- When the text has several topics and is not clearly organized.
- When other cues to the structure of the text and the relative importance of details aren’t available.
- When the reader needs assistance in understanding the organization of the text, or the relative importance of details.

# 5. Summaries

> Summarizing is the heart of note-taking.

Summaries you create != summaries that are given to you

Different types:

- Topical: summarize the main points without adding any new information, this is usually provided after the text.
- Outlines, graphic organizers, multimedia, maps: usually provided after sections of text.
- Overview: usually given before the text.

Summaries are a great priming tool.

The first step in taking notes is not to read the text, but to prepare yourself for it.

> It's difficult to prime yourself when you have 3-5 lectures in a row to attend to everyday.

**What do you need to know?**

If there's no summary at the beginning, maybe there's one at the end. Maybe reading it first is the right way to go.

Advance organizers are typically written at a higher level of abstraction, it's less detailed. Overviews, like summaries, say nothing that is not in the text; advance organizers do.

Interestingly, it seems that the benefit of an advance organizer is greter if students don't read the text immediately after reading the organizer, but have a short delay before doing so.

- A topical summary is a straightforward string of factual statements.
- Topical summaries summarize the main points without adding any new
- information or offering a new perspective.
- Topical summaries have the same functions and disadvantages as headings.
- An overview is a topical summary that precedes the text.
- Overviews make it easier to read and understand text.
- Like overviews, advance organizers precede the text.
- Advance organizers are concerned with the big picture.
- Advance organizers help you connect new facts and ideas to knowledge you already have.

## Creating Summaries

Although summarizing is an effective strategy for learning from text, it’s been estimated that perhaps half of all college students can’t do it effectively.

A good summary:

- is short
- contains only, and all, the most important information
- is in your own words

Identifying or creating topic sentences is a critical part of summarizing, and it is the most difficult

1. delete trivial material
1. delete redundant material
1. replace lists of items with a superordinate term
1. select a topic sentence
1. if no topic sentence given, create one

Clearly, the most difficult part is the last one.

## Summarizing step-by-step

If there's no summary or headings, you could start by skimming the text. Skimming involves looking for *signal* words and phrases, skipping all the information that provides background or supporting information.

**Don't summarize as you go, do it after the text**

**The best summaries are made without reference to the text.**

Check that the idea you had while priming is the same after you read the text, if not, update it.

It may be that the text has confused you. You thought you knew what the theme of the text was; now, drowning in details, you’re not sure. If you’re having trouble figuring out the main idea, look for repetition &mdash; references that are repeated throughout the text. How often a writer refers to an idea is a good clue to how important she thinks it is. Also look for opportunities for generalization. If there are lists of items, categorize them. Sometimes the main idea is hidden among the details.

Once you’ve worked out the main idea of the text, you need to identify the supporting ideas. Do that by grouping together paragraphs on the same topic and labelling them.

Even if the ideas are described clearly in a single sentence, you should still try to put in your own words — only then will you know you understand it.

The checklist:

- Have you stated the main idea of the passage?
- Do you have all the important information?
- Have you included any information that is not important?
- Is it in your own words?

The most difficult part of this process is certainly constructing the main idea when it isn’t succinctly expressed in a single topic sentence — remember, this is the step that even college students managed only half the time. The part students find easiest is deleting the unimportant information7

> **To summarize effectively requires you to look beyond the surface words &mdash; to understand the text in more abstract terms than those in which the text is expressed.**

It’s worth noting, too, that summarizing after a delay has been shown to be dramatically more effective in terms of the student understanding how well they’ve learned the material.

Rules for more effective summarizing:

1. Preview and reflect
1. Read
1. Identify the main idea, and put it in your own words (without looking at the text)
1. Identify the important supporting ideas, and put them in your own words
1. Check

> Google minor details you're missing and that are impairing you from answering the big questions.

You are not trying to record everything you read / hear — you are recording what you need help to remember.

Repetition of words is an indication of importance.

> **This is a useful lesson, and points to something you should take to heart: the
less you understand, the fuller your notes will tend to be — because you can’t
tell what’s important and what’s not. The more you understand, the more
scanty your notes will be — because you have captured the gist, you have
recorded only what is important.**

# Graphic Summaries

Graphic summaries reorganize the text.

They are typically either:

- Trees
- Matrices

Basically, graphic organizers are visual outlines showing relationships. Both outlines and graphic organizers are useful strategies for hierarchical information. However, while an outline does pick out the most important information and does show hierarchical relations (and, as you may have noticed, can include more detail more easily), it is not as effective in showing the relationships between concepts.

In general, graphic organizers are more effective than outlines &mdash; but not invariably. In a study involving text summaries, graphic organizers were superior only when the students had enough time to study them properly.

But **sometimes graphic organizers are less effective than outlines**, and this may be because graphic organizers can make it too easy to see the relations. Because of this, the reader doesn’t need to work as hard to understand the material, with the consequence that the material isn’t processed to the extent that it needs to be for lasting memory. This doesn’t apply, of course, if you’re constructing the graphic organizer yourself.

Graphic organizers have an advantage over outlines in terms of **cognitive load**. Remember how I said working memory is thought to have two sub- systems — one that is essentially visual, and one essentially auditory. When we read text, notwithstanding we are receiving the information through our visual sense, we tend to encode it through auditory working memory (because words are fundamentally sound-based). There is evidence that graphic organizers use visual working memory more than auditory, while outlines use auditory more than visual. The advantage of a graphic organizer, therefore, may lie partly in its reduction of cognitive load — that is, by spreading the load on working memory between both systems3

Additionally, the use of visual information in addition to verbal information creates more retrieval paths (paths along the connected links from initial cue to the memory you’re looking for), increasing the chances of finding the information again.

If you’re simply aiming to learn the “facts” (i.e., you’re not trying to develop your understanding), then research indicates an outline will be just as productive as a graphic organizer5. If the text is short (1000 words or less), an outline is probably better6. But with longer and more complex material, it would seem that graphic organizers are worth the trouble. In such cases, research also suggests that several graphic organizers are most effective 7 — a warning that we shouldn’t try to cram too much information into a graphic organizer.

Outlines are useful for showing hierarchical information and relationships within clusters, but not for displaying relationships between clusters.

Constructing a graphic organizer:

1. Divide your text into passages of around 1500 words
1. Outline the main ideas in the passage
1. Choose a graphical organizer format that fits the
structure of the information
1. Fit your main ideas into the format
1. If it doesn’t work, reconsider the structure of the
information
1. Try again!

## Multimedia Summaries

In multimedia summaries, pictures and words are combined.

Illustrations are most useful when they portray a series of steps, in a cause-and-effect chain, with explanatory text that is integrated with the illustrations.

Illustrations can help learning:

- when the text contains a cause-and-effect chain rather than a list of facts
- when the illustration contain a series of frames showing the steps, together with integrated labels, rather than a one-frame static image
- when the students are unfamiliar with the subject
- when the students are tested on their understanding rather than their ability to simply regurgitate rote-learned material

The best graphic multimedia summaries are:

- concise
- coherent
- coordinated

> Page 105 for *implementation intentions*.

One problem with many illustrations is that they include a lot of irrelevant information, which gets in the way of learning.

> The example broken diagram on page 99 and the corrected one on page 104 are great illustrations of the process. But I think that, in the end, the image where everything is happening at once should also be included because it helps in developing a top-down, big picture view.

Rules for effective multimedia summaries:

- Be very concise.
- Use a minimum of text.
- Coordinate words and images.

## Maps

There’s quite a lot of evidence that when a geographic map is provided, students remember more of the text information that is referenced in the map than they would if only given the text12 (but best if the map is examined before reading the text).

> Maps + Memory Palaces

**On maps, you pay attention to the relationships, not the features themselves.**

Maps seem to be particularly useful as a kind of visual advance organizer, suggesting that if a map is provided, you are advised to study it before reading the text. But you can also use maps as a means of taking notes. One study has found that students who drew a map as they read about a fictitious country understood and remembered much more. Copying details onto a blank map has also been found to be useful.

The most important of these conditions, it has been suggested, is that the information can be chunked together in such a way as not to exceed working memory capacity.

This argument suggests that maps with only a limited number of features on them are useful. One study suggested the optimum number of features is between 12 and 16.

Visual Language is a term Robert Horn uses to refer to "language based on tight integration of words and visual elements". Horn has tried to create a grammar for this language, and given the number and usefulness of note- taking formats that use visual language,

Information block ~ paragraph

4 principles for constructing information blocks:

- Chunking
- Relevance
- Consistency
- Labeling
(- Hierarch)

Criteria for labeling:

- Clear
- Brief
- Consistent
- Familiar
- Appropriate
- Independent

Labels should be like advance organizers, preparing the reader for what's in the block.

## Arranging information

**Gestalt Principles**:

- Proximity
- Similarity
- Common region
- Connectedness
- Continuation
- Closure

Horn's major arrangement classes:

- Matrix
- Concentric
- Level
- Proximity grouping
- Boundary
- Network (Graphs and Trees)

## Information Classes

- Procedure: involves sequential steps for accomplishing a task
- Process: involves sequential events leading to a specific end
- Structure: defines the parts of something
- Classification: involves dividing things into classes
- Concept: defines a group of things
- Fact: bare information that states something without providing any evidence
- Principle: such as rules and guidelines

A procedure is most commonly a linear activity, while a process is equally (if not more) likely to be a loop.

> And to think that people would dislike me for creating hierarchical structures when talking about classes in OOP...

> Page 119 features everything in a diagram.

According to one analysis, people fall into two types: *visualizers* and *verbalizers*. Of course, this is a continuum not a dichotomy; we all visualize, and we all verbalize. “Visualizers” are defined as people who rely mainly on imagery processes when performing cognitive tasks, while “verbalizers” are those who prefer to process information verbally.

2 types of visualizers:

- Iconic: detailed images
- Spatial: images to represent spatial relations

Another very relevant finding of that study was that, in general, people had a good idea of their learning style and their spatial ability.

Drawing helps comprehension and free recall rather than recognition. There’s evidence that drawing helps you construct an integrated mental model, while simply looking at illustrations with text may produce a verbal and a visual mental representation, but not an integrated one. Integration (which helps both memory and comprehension) doesn’t seem to happen naturally, but requires some active task that forces you to integrate the two.

# Part II - Connection Strategies

Connection, not selection, is the heart of what makes information meaningful.

In particular, it's about those strategies that help you make connections that
foster understanding.

- asking questions
- making comparisons
- looking for similarities and differences
- making analogies
- drawing concept maps
- drawing mind maps

Mnemonics don't make connections that help you build your understanding. They make connections that help you memorize details, which is a very different thing.

## 7. Understanding Connection

You can learn info by *rote* (simple repetition) or by using *mnemonic* aid, but you will remember information much better for longer if you *understand the connections* between facts.

One of the best ways of creating connections is through *questions*. And one of the most powerful questions to ask is *why*.

Don't just answer questions, connect them.

Facts that you already know very well and have no trouble remembering act as anchor points. **The more anchor points you can connect to, the more meaningful the new information becomes, and the more easily you will remember it.**

If we don’t understand something, it’s much more difficult to remember. Accordingly, effective note-taking not only involves selecting the important information, it also involves making it meaningful to you.

Counterintuitively:

> Making information meaningful is about connecting new information to existing knowledge. The more connections you make, the better you will understand the information. Moreover, the more connections you have, the more entry points you have to the information, therefore the easier it will be to find in your memory.

This then, is how you can judge the value of a particular note-taking strategy in a particular situation — ask yourself:

- Does it help me connect the facts together?
- Does it help me connect the new information with information I already have?
- Does it make any connection with facts I already know very well, and am unlikely to forget?

## 8. Elaboration Strategies

Elaboration is what enables you to connect new information to the information already in your mental database.

How to elaborate:

- Comparisons
    - Look for *differences*(alignable and nonalignable) and *similarities*.
    - People find it easier to list differences for things that are similar. And listing differences between similar objects *increases* their perceived similarity.
    - Making analogies is hard: in a study where people were given a problem to solve after reading a story in which an analogous problem was solved, 80% didn’t think of using the story to solve the problem until the analogy was pointed out to them9.
        - Analogy requires more effort and more examples than simple similarity. Running comparisons on structure is no simple task. And you also need to take *context* into account.
        - You can also create analogies, when you're not familiar with the topic, by aligning structures, analogical encoding or mutual alignment:
            1. View examples side by side
            1. Assign specific correspondences between the elements of each example (correspondence list)
            1. describe them as a unit, by comparing one to the other (joint interpreation)
- Asking questions
    - Bad questions can be worse than no questions at all. Rote questions that direct your attention to unimportant details are better not asked.
    - Effective questions *prepare* you to pay attention to the important details in the text. The best questions not only direct your attention appropriately, but also require you to *integrate* the details in the text.
    - Elaborative interrogation guides you to construct reasons for the relationships between bits of information, taking you beyond the information given to you.
        - Elaborative interrogation = asking *why* questions.
        - The key is to focus on questions **consistent** and **coherent** with the information you're trying to learn.
    - Several studies have found that creating interactive images is just as effective as elaborative interrogation. Imagery, through the creation of interactive images, makes connections, and also promotes distinctiveness.
        - Imagery is a better strategy when concepts are unfamiliar.
    - Self-explanation: probably only effective when the text is demanding
        - Self-explanation, because its emphasis is on clearly describing the material presented, is also thought to rely less on prior knowledge than elaborative interrogation. This makes it the better strategy for a novice.
- Mnemonics
    - Mnemonic strategies are “artificial” memory aids such as stories, rhymes, acronyms, and more complex strategies involving verbal mediators or visual imagery.
    - They do **not** help you understand the material.

In other words, digging into examples to see their structure not only means that the material you are currently working on is more effectively encoded, but that relevant examples in memory become better encoded (memory is not simply a matter of construction but of re-construction; there is nothing final about a memory code, you tweak it every time you retrieve it).

What’s the difference between similarity and analogy? Analogy is a very specialized type of similarity &mdash; a similarity solely of relations. A computer screen and a keyboard may be considered analogous to paper and pen, but they are not similar.

Analogies are worth seeking out, because they are a very effective means of developing understanding. But they are difficult to come up with on your own, so don’t worry too much if you can’t.

## 9. Concept Maps

Concept maps were developed by Joseph D. Novak in 1972.

The technique is based on the idea that meaningful learning requires you to connect new concepts to existing knowledge1. Broadly speaking, a concept map is a graphic display that attempts to show how concepts are connected to each other. More specifically, a concept map is a diagram in which labeled nodes represent concepts, and lines connecting them show the relationships between concepts.

Mind maps are a specialized form of concept map popularized very successfully by Tony Buzan.

> A popular open software for creating concept maps is `Cmap`.

The second thing to note is that all the links are labeled. It’s onething to realize that two concepts are connected; it’s quite another to be ableto articulate the nature of that connection.

There are 3 stages when concept maps are useful:

- At the beginning &mdash; remember priming and advance organizers
- At the end, for reviewing.
- As a way of taking notes.

> Another piece of software for creating concept maps: SmartDraw

The more references to a node the more important it likely is.

Whe there's no obvious place to start, we have a symptom of a deeper malaise:

- We should have started by framing a question.
- Sort concepts hierarchically, from top to bottom &mdash; though not everyone obeys this rule.

Constructing the map is inherently iterative.

We don’t have to include all possible connections; in fact, we shouldn’t. What we need to do is select what’s important in the context of our focal question.

## When to use concept maps

- Great for sorting out and the big picture
- Terrible for details
    - Nested maps might help.

But not all information lends itself to concept mapping. Sequential information, for example, is more appropriately represented in a linear structure.

Break things down into 4-item chunks, which will gradually become your building blocks.

## Mind Maps vs Concept Maps

4 essential characteristics:

- the subject is crystallized in a central image
- main themes radiate from it as branches
- the branches comprise a key image or key word
- the branches form a connected nodal structure

Keywords — what Buzan calls BOIs (Basic Ordering Ideas) —are basically concepts, as we’ve used them in concept maps. Basically, what mind maps dois display keywords in a memorable format. So, again, like concept maps,they’re about the big picture, not the detail.

The **essential difference** between a mind map and the more general conceptmap is that in a mind map the main themes are connected only to this singlecentral image — not to each other. In a concept map, there are no restrictions on the links between concepts.

The connections between concepts in a concept map are labeled — they have meaning; they’re a particular kind of connection. In a mind map,connections are simply links; they could mean anything.

Images are also far more ambiguous than words.

> Buzan greatly emphasizes the creative aspect of mind maps. Along with the pictures, he wants lots of color. Basically, he sees a mind map as a work of art, and talks about the noncreative, stultifying nature of linear notes.

Mind maps are good for:

- generating ideas
- getting your head in the right space preparatory to listening to a
lecture or reading a text
- doing a quick review — checking that you have all the main points
down before a test.

> Mind maps are very personal, and reflect the point of view you have at the time of its construction.

**Mind maps are best as a thinking aid rather than a note-taking strategy**.

> You need to be more focused when summarizing than when brainstorming.

The relative disorganization of a mind map also makes it harder to know ifyou’ve covered everything. The only answer to that is to check it against amore structured outline.

If there are too many connections between nodes, then a mind map isprobably not the best way to represent the topic. A concept map would be better. Remember that in a mind map, the subtopics (the BOIs) are only connected to the main topic (the Central Image), not to each other. Of course this means the mind map is generally a gross simplification of a topic, since subtopics rarely only connect to each other through the main idea.

# Part III - Applying your Strategies

## 10. Taking notes in lectures

### How taking notes in lectures is different from taking notes from text

So far, I have talked almost exclusively about notetaking from text. That is partly because far more research has been done on this topic than on notetaking from lectures, and partly because it’s much easier to teach, and learn, to take effective notes from text.

Differences to text:

- Rate of presentation, i.e., you must keep up with the lecturer
- You cannot go back

100 words/minute seems to be optimal for lectures, but the normal rate is 150, so good lectures seem slow.

Lecture notetaking helps by encoding information:

- Deepening the processing of the material
- Generating material to review

Ideally 60% of the information in the lecture is recorded in the notes, but the variability is so high that number becomes a bit meaningless.

In the survey, information that was written on the board was, unsurprisingly, much more likely to be recorded (88% on average, compared to only 52% of information that wasn’t recorded on the board).

> **grades being higher for students who recorded more of the information units not written on the board**.

Students in the study also suggests that students greatly overestimate the adequacy of their notes.

The amount of information recorded in the second twenty minute period was significantly less than that recorded in the first twenty minutes.

One of the problems with lecture notetaking is that some of your attention isspent on your own hand-movements and the writing you’re producing. It’sbeen found that notetaking is best (produces the greatest benefit) whenyou’re taking notes from a purely audio source (a tape recording or a podcast, say), and worst when the source is audio-visual (as in a lecture).

But there is some evidence4 that typing (rather than writing by hand) may partially overcome this problem.

> One comparison found that the average typist can produce 33 words per minute compared to 19 WPM for the average hand writer

This strategy would particularly help students with a low working memory capacity, and also (we may speculate) students with low background knowledge (because they need to take much fuller notes).

Keeping pace means you want to use as many abbreviations as you can.Oddly, most students don’t tend to make much use of abbreviations anddiagrams in their notes. One study5, for example, found that only 40% ofstudents showed any sort of abbreviations, and for the most part these werelimited to ‘e.g.’ and arrows (for ‘therefore’ or ‘leads to’). Another study6,analyzing 25 sets of lecture notes, found that only 20% used abbreviationsand only 12% included diagrams.

> Use autocorrect and aliases to make typing more agile.

Forcing students to take notes only benefits those students with low prior knowledge of the topic; those with greater knowledge show no benefit.

This reworking stage is best done as soon as possible after the lecture, so thatthe information is fresh enough that you can expand on the notes. Indeed,one study8 found that note-taking was even better if students were given three five-minute pauses during the lecture to add to and revise their notes.

When teachers provide support, relax &mdash; though you still need to take notes.

*Teacher notes are actually written text*.

Recording lectures is of great help to taking notes, specially to lower-level ideas.

Better notetakers note more of the important ideas.

Don’t overlook the benefits of collaboration! Because students are, by and large, such poor note-takers in lectures, collaboration can be very useful, especially in the early days.

### Reworking, not recopying

Recopying your notes afterwards is a huge waste of time.

### Preparation is key

Here we come back to your beliefs about the purpose of lectures. If you thinkthe purpose of lectures is to be your sole, or at the very least main, source ofinformation, then you’ll be sceptical of this advice. But if you see lecturesmore as guides, then you’ll realize that the better you understand the topic, the more you reduce the amount of notes you need to take.

### Mindwandering is your enemy

Most of the power toprevent mindwandering is of course with the lecturer — carefully spacedmoments of interaction provide one obvious strategy, and one particularlyeffective activity is getting students to answer questions on the material from the preceding part of the lecture

One study, which found that there was significantly more mindwanderingin the second half (52% vs 35%), and that students got significantly morequestions right on a post-lecture test if the questions came from the first half(71% vs 57%), showed that the simple act of asking whether or not thestudent’s mind had been wandering, was enough to bring their attentionback to the lecture (when some questions were taken from just before themindwandering probes and just after, it was found that the first half vssecond half difference wasn’t there for post-probe questions). Perhaps youcould use your laptop or phone to periodically ask the question.

Another study 13 interspersed a 21-minute video lecture with three 3-minutebreaks, during which students either did arithmetic problems, or did a fewproblems followed by a quick test on the material covered in the previouslecture segment. Those who were tested showed less mindwandering, tookmore notes, and did much better on the test at the end of the lecture (84% vs59%). A follow-up experiment added a group who studied the test answers,but were not actually tested. The performance of this group was notsignificantly different, on any of these measures, from the other non-tested group. Scores on the final test were: 89% vs 70% vs 65% (tested, nontested, restudy groups, respectively).

A fascinating finding was that, despite all this, the students in the testedgroup actually found the lecture less mentally taxing than those in the other two groups.

Another possible strategy for reducing mindwandering is meditation. There’ssome evidence14 that a brief (6 minutes) period of focused meditation beforethe lecture reduces mindwandering. The focused meditation simply involved closing one’s eyes and counting breaths.

## 11. Using your notes

- to provide a record
    - Important when you will not be able to recover what's being exposed.
    - However it's important to say that the lecture itself is an *opportunity to find out what the lecturer thinks is important*.
- to focus attention
    - Particularly important when the information is boring or dull.
- to reduce cognitive load
    - Note-taking strategies, like any strategies, can also add to your cognitiveload, in the initial stages, when you are still unskilled at using the strategies.This is why less successful learners so often use less effective strategies —because they are less demanding. And why are they less demanding? Not because of any inherent demands of the strategy — successful learners are using them without any trouble — but because any skill is more demanding when you are learning it.
    - How much time you spend studying doesn't have much relationship to how well you do academically.
    - Research into expertise has provided convincing evidence that experts, bethey musicians or chess masters or top sportspeople, achieve their expertiseby engaging in a considerable amount of deliberate practice — a term coinedby the foremost researcher in the field to refer to high quality, focused practice.
    - What distinguishes deliberate practice from less productive practice?
        - The acquisition of expert performance needs to be broken down into a sequence of attainable training tasks.
        - Each of these tasks requires a well-defined goal.
        - Feedback for each step must be provided.
        - Repetition is needed — but that repetition is not simple; rather thestudent should be provided with opportunities that gradually refine his performance.
        - Attention is absolutely necessary — it is not enough to simply mechanically “go through the motions”.
        - The aspiring expert must constantly and attentively monitor her progress, adjusting and correcting her performance as required.
    - It's been found that the habit of studying alone in a quiet environment is associated with better academic performance.
    - Use deliberate effort on what you feel most difficult.
    - Less effort != less enjoyable. And students conflate them, it's usually the latter that causes the most trouble.
    - The more organized you are when encoding information, the more easily it will be remembered.
- to organize information
    - Take conscious control over it.
- to help you select what’s important
    - Typically that's not a given when studying, but, in the context of a lecture, that's usually set by the lecturer, if he/she is a good one. So you better focus on the cues and unwritten important remarks.
- to help you make connections
- to help you review
    - You won't be able to take it at the first go.
    - Do not simply re-read your notes, paraphrase them and reshape them.
    - But basically the process of review involves a repeated selection of important information until you are left with one single brief sentence or keyword for each coherent unit of information.
    - Reviewing after a delay will give you a much better sense of how well you really understand the material.

## 12. Learning style and individual differences

The main differences:

- Differences in cognitive style
- Differences in learning preferences
- Differences in ability
    - Differences in skills (particularly reading skill, in this context)
    - Differences in knowledge
    - Differences in working memory capacity
- Differences in motivation and interest level

Notice that differences in ability encompass three areas of difference, only one of which is in any way innate.

Differences in working memory capacity are more problematic. Althoughtraining programs to increase working memory capacity have had somemeasure of success, it is very specific to the particular tasks being targeted.This doesn’t mean that there’s no value to such programs, but it does suggestthat adult working memory capacity is less malleable than we hoped(working memory capacity does increase during childhood, as the braindevelops — unfortunately, it also may shrink in old age).

It is important then to be aware of when your WMC isn't working in your favor. Practice in a specific topic might help in lowering the demand on WMC. And paying attention to environmental factors, like silence and worrying, is also key.

### Interest and Motivation

That interest and motivation are linked together. Interest is of course also connected to knowledge — the more you know, the more interested you’ll be, and as your interest in a subject grows, so does the easewith which you acquire more knowledge.

Interest may be an indirect measure of another critical factor: your inclination for effortful processing — that is, the pleasure you take in engaging your mind. Which brings us to motivation.

Students’ motives have been categorized as belonging to one of three categories:

- A pure interest in the subject for its own sake
- The need to do well (perhaps to gain a qualification, or to look good in front of other people)
- The need to avoid looking a fool

It’s not surprising that these last two are associated with a tendency to only process information superficially.

Of course, if you’re very competitive, or have a compelling need to do well, you will also be more likely to put the effort in.

> Perhaps that's why the CCP can't get past copying and stealing other people.

> Intrinsic and Extrinsic motives.

3 types of learning:

- Surface
    - Surface learners also tend to focus on the words rather than the writer’s meaning.
    - For people who feel incapable, there is a way: take things level by level: words, then propositions then macropropositions.
- Achieving
    - Nearly as effective as the deep approach, however the focus is still on the end product.
- Deep
    - Search for understanding and connections.

### Cognitive Style

- **Wholist-Analytic**: whether you tend to organize information in wholes or parts
- **Verbal-Imagery**: whether you tend to represent information in your thoughts verbally or in pictures

These are dimensions, not dichotomies! Few of us will be at the extremes. Though our education system tends to favor an analytical approach.

Wholists, for example, are good at seeing things in context, but may missimportant details and are more likely to have trouble selecting what’simportant. Analytics are good at detail and good at seeing similarities anddifferences, but may focus on one or two aspects to the exclusion of other,equally important, aspects. Analytics like a step-by-step approach, whilewholists can get confused by such an approach, particularly when the stepsare large. Analytics may find overviews confusing; wholists may be confused without an overview. Interestingly, analytics tend to prefer to take control of their learning, but wholists don’t care.

In general, imagers prefer and learn best from pictorial presentations, whileverbalizers prefer and learn best from text. Imagers remember visuallydescriptive text better than acoustically complex and unfamiliar text;verbalizers remember complex and unfamiliar text better than visually descriptive text.

The two dimensions also pair off. Wholist and imager styles go together; analytic and verbalizer styles are similarly compatible.

Interestingly, the same study found that working memory capacity seems tobe of much less importance to wholists than analytics. Analytic processingprobably requires much more capacity than wholist processing. Similarly,although not to the same extent, verbalizers are more affected by workingmemory capacity than imagers. This implies that reducing cognitive load ismuch more important for low working memory analytic-verbalizers thananyone else.

> Strive for integrating all styles.

### Learning preferences

Learning preferences encompass personal properties that affect the best conditions for cognitive processing to take place.

> Take a look at the 5 classes of elements of the Dunn & Dunn style model. Out of all preferences, the perceptual ones may be the most important ones. Most people are affected by 6 to 14 of the 15 elements. If you think about all the different combinations of elements that are possible, you’ll see why no single instructional or learning method can work for everyone.
