# Raspberry Pi

## Installing Gitlab

### Troubleshooting

Most of the solutions to common problems have solutions here:

[How to install GitLab on your Raspberry Pi? – RaspberryTips](https://raspberrytips.com/gitlab-installation-raspberry-pi/)

## Installing Nextcloud

- You can configure `fail2ban`, which bans people trying to brute force their way into your server.
- There's also `automount`, which lets you use an external hard drive as the source for space.

```sh
sudo apt install snapd
```

A better way of doing this is by going through OwnYourBits' tutorial/script:

- [Install Nextcloud on a RaspberryPi to create your own google drive at home! // 4K Tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aGKWkGTmAw)
