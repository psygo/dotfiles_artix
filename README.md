# My Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux; I focus a lot on minimalism. Anyway, I currently use:

- Kitty as my terminal, very fast and supports font ligatures
- Neovim as my in-terminal editor
- Emacs as my editor for software projects
	- With Evil Mode
- [XMonad][xmonad] as a Window Manager
- `XMonad.Prompt` as an application launcher
- ranger as an in-terminal file manager
- Nemo as my GUI file manager &mdash; #shameless
- Qutebrowser as my default browser
	- Brave, with cVim, is my backup
- Zathura as a Vim-like way of viewing PDFs
    - However Okular is still a big part of my workflow, specially when it comes to long books

I also use some custom command-line programs which help create a more modern environment, like Rust's [`exa`][exa] and [`bat`][bat]. Another strong recommendation I have is the amazing [`fzf`][fzf] multi-tool, which also happens to have strong Vim integration through a plugin.
