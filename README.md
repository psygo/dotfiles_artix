# My Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux &mdash; I'm currently using the [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/) distro &mdash;; I focus a lot on minimalism. Anyway, I currently use:

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my terminal, very fast and supports font ligatures
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as my default monospaced, ligated font; and Cantarell as my non-monospaced default font
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my in-terminal editor
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as my editor for software projects
    - With [Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)
    - [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as a backup editor
- [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/) as a Window Manager
- [`XMonad.Prompt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Prompt.html) as an application launcher
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as an in-terminal file manager
- [Krusader](https://krusader.org/) as my GUI file manager
    - And [Nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo) for quick stuff
- [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) as my default browser
    - [Brave](https://brave.com/) with [cVim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh?hl=en), is my backup
- [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) as a Vim-like way of viewing PDFs
    - However [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) is still a big part of my workflow, specially when it comes to long books
- [Ferdi](https://getferdi.com/) as my messenger-unifying browser.
- [Sabaki](https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/) as my Go SGF editor.

I also use some custom command-line programs which help create a more modern environment, like Rust's [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat). Another strong recommendation I have is the amazing [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) multi-tool, which also happens to have strong Vim integration through a plugin.
