# My Dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Linux; I focus a lot on minimalism. Anyway, I currently use:

- Konsole as my terminal &mdash; mostly because it supports font ligatures
- Neovim
- Emacs &mdash; [Doom Emacs][doom_emacs] &mdash;, mostly for some notes in Org-mode &mdash; might fully transition from [Notion][notion]
- [XMonad][xmonad] as a Window Manager
- ~~dmenu~~ `XMonad.Prompt` as an application launcher
- ranger as an in-terminal file manager
- Nemo as my GUI file manager &mdash; #shameless
- Brave as my default browser
- Zathura as a Vim-like way of viewing PDFs &mdash; though Okular is still a big part of my workflow

I also have some custom command-line programs which help create a more modern environment, like Rust's [`exa`][exa] and [`bat`][bat]. Another strong recommendation I have is the amazing [`fzf`][fzf] multi-tool, which also happens to have Vim integration via a plugin.
